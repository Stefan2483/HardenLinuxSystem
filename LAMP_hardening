# Disable Dangerous PHP Functions Edit the php.ini file to disable functions that can be exploited for RCE, such as exec(), shell_exec(), system(), passthru(), eval(), and others:
disable_functions = exec,shell_exec,system,passthru,eval

# Set strict file permissions on the web server. Use 755 for directories and 644 for files to limit executable permissions.
